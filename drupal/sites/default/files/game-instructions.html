<p>
    The <span class="fdv-brand-text">5 Degrees of Vegan</span> game challenges you to find the connections between two vegan actors using no more than five degrees (or steps) of separation, using movies they were in to link together a chain using other vegan actor co-stars.  You must end up with a provable connection of vegan actors and movie appearances together.

    The <span class="fdv-brand-text">5&deg; Vegan</span> website database is your source to find and prove the connections you make.

    Simple, really. . .  Or is it?
</p>


<h1>Official 5 Degrees of Vegan Game Rules:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Choose a primary vegan/vegetarian actor, then think of a second vegan celebrity to try and find a connection between them.</li>
    <li>Click on <a href="/actor">Actor Search</a> or <a href="/movie">Movie Search</a> and compare the celebrity’s work to begin to make connections between him/her and your named vegan/vegetarian actor or actress. (For example:  Was “x” in a movie with the primary vegan actor?  Did one of his/her co-stars appear in a movie with the vegan actor?  Did their co-star appear in a movie with another co-star that played in a movie with the vegan actor?)</li>
    <li>Build the degrees of separation by searching movies and actors from your first search results.  Count how many different steps are required to make a complete connection to the primary vegan actor.</li>
    <li style="list-style: none;">- Tips for Success:  Use people who are publicly known co-stars from movie appearances or known acquaintances to establish a connection with the primary vegan actor.</li>
</ol>


<strong>Variation Game 1:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Name a vegan/vegetarian actor/actress.</li>
    <li>The next player names a movie with that actor.</li>
    <li>The following player names either a different vegan/vegetarian actor in that movie or another movie with the previous actor appeared in.</li>
    <li>Keep going until someone gets stumped.  The person who can’t continue gets a “V”.  The player who just got stumped may choose to start the next round by naming a new vegan actor, or may pass to the next player.</li>
    <li>When anyone spells “Vegan” he or she is out.</li>
    <li>The game continues until only one player remains – Victory!</li>
</ol>

Other possible rules for players to decide on before the game begins are:
<ol>
    <li>If you are stumped, you can reverse the clue back to the person who gave it to you and if he/she can’t name another person or film, a letter goes to both of you.</li>
    <li>Decide if you will accept voice-only performances, such as in animated films.  The standard is "Yes".</li>
</ol>


<strong>Variation Game 2:</strong>

<p>
Start with two movies, and then try to connect them in as few steps as possible using vegan/vegetarian actors.  For a challenge, try to connect a really old movie with a much newer one.
</p>


<strong>Variation Game 3:</strong>

<p>
Try to make the longest chain possible between two vegan celebrities, using as many other celebrities as you can along the way. You’ll need to write them down, so you can calculate the winner once everyone has had a turn. 
-	Decide if you’ll accept actors who were virtually unrecognizable due to costuming or extensive disguise makeup.
</p>


<strong>Variation Game 4:</strong>

<ol>
    <li>Player One names a vegan/vegetarian actor or actress and then looks them up on 5 Degrees of Vegan. (Always in that order, no looking them up first.)</li>
    <li>Player One tells player two how many films that person has listed here.</li>
    <li>Player Two tries to name as many of them as possible within a prearranged amount of time (recommend 2 minutes.)</li>
    <li>Player Two receives one point for every movie correctly named and one negative point for incorrect movie guesses.</li>
    <li>Play continues for as many rounds as you want, either for a predetermined number of rounds or until someone reaches a previously agreed upon score.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Variation Game 5:</strong> &nbsp;(the drinking game)

<p>
    The <span class="italic">Tipsy Vegan Name Game</span> is a drinking game variation for the <span class="fdv-brand-text">5 Degrees of Vegan</span> game.
</p>

<ol style="list-style: none;">
    <li>
    The game begins with one person saying the first and last name of a famous vegan actor or celebrity.  The celebrity must be well-known enough for at least one other player to have heard of them and agree that they are veg*n.
    </li>
    <li>
    The next player then says the first and last name of another famous vegan, only this time the name must begin with the first letter of the surname of the last vegan named.  For example: Ted <strong>D</strong>anson is first named and second is <strong>D</strong>ustin Hoffman. Use the 5 Degree Vegan <a href="/actor-list">actors list</a> to challenge, confirm, or refute the vegan actors’ names as you go.
    </li>
    <li>
    If a player names a vegan with both first and last names starting with the same letter, the order of play is reversed.  For Example: Lisa Bonet is the first name given, then Betty <strong>D</strong>river, and then <strong class="underline">D</strong>anny <span class="underline">D</span>eVito – Play reverses so that the previous player who named Betty Driver has to go again.
    </li>
    <li>
    The tricky part of this game is that each player has a very limited time to provide a new name, usually 5 to 10 seconds.  If a player is stumped and unable to name a vegan within the time limit, he or she drinks:  usually a sip of beer, cider, or wine.  Remember to always drink responsibly.  Be sure to check <a href="http://www.barnivore.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Barnivore</a> to make sure your drink is vegan.  <img src="/sites/default/files/pictures/smiley.png" alt="smiley" class="fdv-smiley" />

</ol>
